## Usage

### As a CLI program

```
/path_to_python_env/bin/joboffers <api_name> <location> <paginate_max>
```

* For publicly available APIs that we support, it is simple, nothing else is needed. For example:

```
/path_to_python_env/bin/joboffers githubjobs paris 3
```

* Private APIs can also be supported. For such a case, contact us so we can help you build the API and/or access it from the code.
